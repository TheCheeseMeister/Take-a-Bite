  //return "\t\tPicture this: You wake up at 2am in the middle of night and wander downstairs to get some nighttime snacks to help put you back to sleep. Upon opening the fridge, however, you are met with the depressing reality that you don't have any food in stock. Well, nothing except for some cheese, tomato sauce, conviently placed dough and- wait a second. We can just use our sleepy limbs and make ourselves a quick pizza! This recipe goes over the ins and outs of creating a pizza in little time so you can stuff your lil tummy without too much effort taken away from sleepy time.\n\tStarting off, I have no idea how to fill the rest of this. I don't actually know how to make a pizza. Not really anyways. I mean I know what goes into a pizza sure, but does that mean I really know what goes into a pizza? Just filling the space here so I can get something like an actual description. I could have just done Lorem Ipsum but that seems boring. So here we are. Anyways toss that sauce around and your tomato sauce should be ready to go!\n\tMoving on, lets talk dough. I did some stuff with dough when I was younger but I don't remember anything about it now. Playdough, now that I remember. Ya'll ever make little stick people out of playdough and then make up these fights with them until they start ripping each other's fake limbs off and then dramatize the fight? No? Me neither...me neither. There's a lot of text left. This kind of sucks but full send. And with that, you're ready to start putting this bad puppy together.\n\tNow I know it's probably pretty late if you're looking for a midnight snack, so chances are you aren't so awake as your usual self, but this part should be easy: toppings. On the topic of toppings, I find myself enjoying veggie pizza way more than pepperoni pizza or any of those other things. Is that weird? I've come to enjoy it, tomatoes, spinach, maybe mushrooms. It's simple but pretty good. Also sort of reminds me of tomato pie from when I was younger. Sort of cold because it's not meant to be hot...I think. But it's as you imagine it: pie of tomato. I mean that is it. But yummy. Now that all your favorite toppings are on, it's time to bring the heat!\n\tGo find whatever you want to heat this lil guy up: oven, toaster oven, a microwave if that fancies you for whatever weird reason. Toaster ovens are a god send for night time food. Most of the time I find that heating certain things up in the microwave just comes out poor. It's noticeably not as good as it was before, not even close. But a toaster oven, oh that little thing can do it. Sure it's not as great as it was when it just came out the oven or off the stove for the first time. But compared to a microwave? Miles better. Crazy that I would say that considering I'm not a very good chef, but well, y'know. Heat.\n\tHas it been long enough? Check on your pizza and see how it's doing. Doing this stuff at the time I said, like 2am, would be hectic at my house, only cuz I would wake all the cats and they start getting active. Idk at nighttime they like crowding me, like some follow the leader. It's cute and chill, except for it's 5 of them. So you can imagine 5 of them wanting to hang around either seeking food, walking in my way, or trying to get into things either left out on the counter, or just on the counter in general, or things I'm using currently. Oh and the garage too, they love to get lost in the garage. -_-' Case in point they are annoyingly awesome. Until you try to sleep.\n\tAnd that should be it! One nice nighttime pizza ready to go. It didn't take that long right? Hopefully it tastes as good as mine does 'cause oh boy do I smell it right now. Actually y'know what? I think I'll take it to bed with me. Yup, snug right next to me. Me and my pizza and me. Not weird I swear.";
